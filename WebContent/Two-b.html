In recent weeks, a new policy conundrum has emerged for the U.S. as it attempts 
to help launch a peace process in Afghanistan. Soon after the U.S. government formally 
requested Pakistan's assistance to bring the Taliban to the table, Islamabad helped
 facilitate meetings between senior Taliban representatives and U.S. officials in Abu Dhabi. 
 The U.S. government appears to be acknowledging that Pakistan, given its influence over the Taliban, 
is an important and potentially helpful player in the peace process in Afghanistan.
